# Getting Started
## Dependencies
What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (`brew install node`)
* Ensure you're running the latest versions Node `v6.x.x`+ (or `v7.x.x`) and NPM `3.x.x`+

> If you have `nvm` installed, which is highly recommended (`brew install nvm`) you can do a `nvm install --lts && nvm use` in `$` to run with the latest Node LTS. You can also have this `zsh` done for you [automatically](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#calling-nvm-use-automatically-in-a-directory-with-a-nvmrc-file)

Once you have those, you should install these globals with `npm install --global`:
* `webpack` (`npm install --global webpack`)
* `webpack-dev-server` (`npm install --global webpack-dev-server`)
* `karma` (`npm install --global karma-cli`)
* `protractor` (`npm install --global protractor`)
* `typescript` (`npm install --global typescript`)

## Installing
* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install webpack-dev-server rimraf webpack -g` to install required global dependencies
* `npm install` to install all dependencies or `yarn`
* `npm run server` to start the dev server in another tab

## Running the app
After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `npm run server` to start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000` (or if you prefer IPv6, if you're using `express` server, then it's `http://[::1]:3000/`).

### server
```bash
# development
npm run server
# production
npm run build:prod
npm run server:prod
```

## Other commands

### build files
```bash
# development
npm run build:dev
# production (jit)
npm run build:prod
# AoT
npm run build:aot
```

### hot module replacement
```bash
npm run server:dev:hmr
```

### watch and build files
```bash
npm run watch
```

### run unit tests
```bash
npm run test
```

### watch and run our tests
```bash
npm run watch:test
```

### run end-to-end tests
```bash
# update Webdriver (optional, done automatically by postinstall script)
npm run webdriver:update
# this will start a test server and launch Protractor
npm run e2e
```

### continuous integration (run unit tests and e2e tests together)
```bash
# this will test both your JIT and AoT builds
npm run ci
```

### run Protractor's elementExplorer (for end-to-end)
```bash
npm run e2e:live
```

### build Docker
```bash
npm run build:docker
```

# Configuration
Configuration files live in `config/` we are currently using webpack, karma, and protractor for different stages of your application

# AoT Don'ts
The following are some things that will make AoT compile fail.

- Don’t use require statements for your templates or styles, use styleUrls and templateUrls, the angular2-template-loader plugin will change it to require at build time.
- Don’t use default exports.
- Don’t use `form.controls.controlName`, use `form.get(‘controlName’)`
- Don’t use `control.errors?.someError`, use `control.hasError(‘someError’)`
- Don’t use functions in your providers, routes or declarations, export a function and then reference that function name
- @Inputs, @Outputs, View or Content Child(ren), Hostbindings, and any field you use from the template or annotate for Angular should be public

# External Stylesheets
Any stylesheets (Sass or CSS) placed in the `src/styles` directory and imported into your project will automatically be compiled into an external `.css` and embedded in your production builds.

For example to use Bootstrap as an external stylesheet:
1) Create a `styles.scss` file (name doesn't matter) in the `src/styles` directory.
2) `npm install` the version of Boostrap you want.
3) In `styles.scss` add `@import 'bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss';`
4) In `src/app/app.module.ts` add underneath the other import statements: `import '../styles/styles.scss';`

# Deployment

## Docker

To run project you only need host machine with **operating system** with installed **git** (to clone this repo)
and [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and thats all - any other software is not needed
(other software like node.js etc. will be automatically downloaded and installed inside docker container during build step based on dockerfile).

### Install docker

#### MacOS:

`brew cask install docker`

And run docker by Mac bottom menu> launchpad > docker (on first run docker will ask you about password)

#### Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-keys 58118E89F3A912897C070ADBF76221572C52609D
sudo apt-add-repository 'deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-xenial main'
sudo apt-get update
apt-cache policy docker-engine
sudo apt-get install -y docker-engine
sudo systemctl status docker  # test:  shoud be ‘active’
```
And add your user to docker group (to avoid `sudo` before using `docker` command in future):
```
sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)
```
and logout and login again.

### Build image

Because *node.js* is big memory consumer you need 1-2GB RAM or virtual memory to build docker image
(it was successfully tested on machine with 512MB RAM + 2GB virtual memory - building process take 7min)

Go to main project folder. To build big (~280MB) image which has cached data and is able to **FAST** rebuild  
(this is good for testing or staging environment) type:

`docker build -t angular-starter .`

To build **SMALL** (~20MB) image without cache (so each rebuild will take the same amount of time as first build)
(this is good for production environment) type:

`docker build --squash="true" -t angular-starter .`

The **angular-starter** name used in above commands is only example image name.
To remove intermediate images created by docker on build process, type:

`docker rmi -f $(docker images -f "dangling=true" -q)`

### Run image

To run created docker image on [localhost:8080](localhost:8080) type (parameter `-p 8080:80` is host:container port mapping)

`docker run --name angular-starter -p 8080:80 angular-starter &`

And that's all, you can open browser and go to [localhost:8080](localhost:8080).

### Run image on sub-domain

If you want to run image as virtual-host on sub-domain you must setup [proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy)
. You should install proxy and set sub-domain in this way:

 ```
 docker pull jwilder/nginx-proxy:alpine
 docker run -d -p 80:80 --name nginx-proxy -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro jwilder/nginx-proxy:alpine
 ```

 And in your `/etc/hosts` file (linux) add line: `127.0.0.1 angular-starter.your-domain.com` or in yor hosting add
 folowing DNS record (wildchar `*` is handy because when you add new sub-domain in future, you don't need to touch/add any DNS record)

 ```
 Type: CNAME
 Hostname: *.your-domain.com
 Direct to: your-domain.com
 TTL(sec): 43200
 ```

And now you are ready to run image on subdomain by:

```
docker run -e VIRTUAL_HOST=angular-starter.your-domain.com --name angular-starter angular-starter &
```

### Login into docker container

`docker exec -t -i angular-starter /bin/bash`
